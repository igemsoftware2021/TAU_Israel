Bacteria are one of the most ubiquitous organisms on earth, present in both natural and synthetic communities called microbiomes.
They constantly share genetic information in a process called _lateral gene transfer_, which prevents us from being able to engineer specific members of the community.

Using our software, you can take your gene of intrest along with two subpopulations:
- **Optimized organisms**: the bacteria that should be able to express the genetic modification optimally.
- **Deoptimized organisms**: the bacteria that *should not* be able to express the genetic modification. __
And create a **microbiome‫-‬specific version** of any genetic modification- generically and automatically.

## Code
The source code is organized as following- 
1. All front-end design is in the GUI directory, and built using flask
2. Backend development is divided into different modules as specified in our website
3. Model analysis files: used to test our software on real metagenomic data
